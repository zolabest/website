        <section class="section2"> <h1>Africa</h1><h6> Africa, the second largest continent (after Asia), 
            covering about one-fifth of the total land surface of Earth. 
            The continent is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, 
            on the north by the Mediterranean Sea, on the east by the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean,
             and on the south by the mingling waters of the Atlantic and Indian oceans. </h6> </section> 
        <section class="section3"> <h1>African mineral resources</h1><h6>Africa contains an enormous 
            wealth of mineral resources, 
            including some of the worldâ€™s largest reserves of fossil fuels, 
            metallic ores, and gems and precious metals. 
            This richness is matched by a great diversity of biological resources that includes the 
            intensely lush equatorial rainforests of Central Africa and the world-famous populations 
            of wildlife of the eastern and southern portions of the continent. 
            Although agriculture (primarily subsistence) still dominates the 
            economies of many African countries, 
            the exploitation of these resources became the most significant economic activity 
            in Africa in the 20th century.</h6></section>
